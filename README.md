# Python Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

## Project Overview

This project analyzes public intake and outcome data from the **Austin Animal Center (AAC)** to identify patterns in animal intake, outcomes, length of stay, and repeat visits. The broader goal is to support data-driven recommendations that improve operational efficiency and animal welfare, with particular attention to high-utilization and end-of-life cases.

Python is used to clean raw data, standardize inconsistent fields, engineer analytical features, and construct analysis-ready tables used downstream in SQL and Tableau.

## Data Sources

- `Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes.csv`
- `Austin_Animal_Center_Outcomes.csv`

Additional categorical groupings (e.g., species groupings and size classes) were derived in Python and, where appropriate, supplemented in Google Sheets to support consistent classification.

---

## Data Cleaning Strategy

The raw AAC data contains inconsistent formatting, mixed data types, duplicate records, and free-text categorical fields. To address this, reusable pipeline-style cleaning functions were developed and applied consistently across tables.

### General Cleaning Steps

Across intake and outcome data:
- Column names were standardized to `snake_case`
- Whitespace was trimmed and string values normalized
- Datetime fields were validated and coerced to consistent formats
- Duplicate records were removed while preserving legitimate repeat visits
- Unique line-level identifiers were created to support joins and quality checks

---

## Datetime Feature Engineering

From intake and outcome timestamps, multiple time-based features were derived to support operational and staffing analysis:

- Calendar attributes (year, month, day)
- ISO week and ISO year (for standardization)
- Weekday versus weekend classification
- Seasonal grouping
- Operational shift classification (day, swing, overnight)

These features enable later analysis of intake patterns, length of stay, and staffing pressure by time period.

## Intake Table Processing

Raw intake condition values were consolidated into analytically meaningful categories to reduce noise and improve interpretability:

- **Medical** (e.g., sick, injured, medical, aged)
- **Behavioral** (e.g., behavior, feral)
- **Reproductive** (e.g., pregnant, nursing)
- **Routine** (normal)

This grouping reflects real-world handling considerations while preserving operational relevance.

---

## Outcome Table Processing

Outcome data was similarly standardized.

### Outcome Type Consolidation

Raw outcome types were grouped into:
- **Alive** (adoption, return to owner, RTO-adopt)
- **Administrative** (transfer, relocation)
- **Deceased** (euthanasia, died, disposal)
- **Unknown**

### Outcome Subtype Consolidation

Outcome subtypes were grouped into broader categories:
- Location-based
- Behavioral
- Program-related
- Administrative
- Unknown

This structure supports consistent outcome analysis across species and life stages.

## Animal Master Table Construction

A unified animal-level table was created by merging cleaned intake and outcome records. Key transformations include:

- Name normalization and identification of assigned versus intake names
- Age parsing and conversion to standardized year units
- Life stage classification (juvenile, young adult, adult, senior)
- Sex standardization
- Species and subgroup assignment
- Breed simplification and AKC group derivation for dogs
- Cat breed information was limited to coat-length categories (DSH, DMH, DLH); all other values were treated as missing due to known unreliability of breed assignment in shelter populations
- Color normalization and pattern grouping

When attributes changed over time (e.g., age, sex, altered status), the most recent reliable value was retained to reflect the animals final known state.

## Length of Stay (LOS) Table

A dedicated length-of-stay table was generated by pairing each intake with its corresponding outcome:

- Intake and outcome timestamps were matched chronologically
- Length of stay was calculated at the intake outcome level
- This table supports analysis of repeat visits, prolonged stays, and resource-intensive cases

---

## Outputs

Python preprocessing produces the following analysis-ready tables used in SQL and Tableau:

- Cleaned Intake Table  
- Cleaned Outcome Table  
- Animal Master Table  
- Length of Stay (LOS) Table  

These tables form the foundation for downstream querying, visualization, and policy-oriented analysis.
